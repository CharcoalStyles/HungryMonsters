An AS3/Flixel game that I made in 7 hours, using monsters drawn by 5 - 12yo kids.

Designed to be played on a Blackberry Playbook (but also works on desktop); the game sees the player move around a monster by touching the screen (or clicking and dragging), collecting apples before the time runs out. There are other "AI" controlled monsters also doing this.
The game makes use of connected microphones and webcams as well. By yealling into the microphone, the player can scare away the competing monsters. When this happens, it also takes a screnshot of hte player. The idea was to have this upload to a website, but that didn't happen.

I've added a copy of FLixel 1.5 into the repo, to make building easier.
